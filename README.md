# Estimating 𝜋 with Marbles

Claim:
It is possible to estimate 𝜋 to within 10% accuracy by randomly throwing 1,000 marbles onto a table.

Experiement:
Randomly distribute 1 kg marbles over a table with two bowls. One circlular in shape, the other a square, with the radius of the circular bowl equal to 
the side length of the square.
